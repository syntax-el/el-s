    <h1>PAST TO THE PRESENT<h1>
    <h2>GIFT OF LIFE</h2>
 <img src="imgelle/elchpic2.jpg">
<p>August 11, 2006 was the day I was born into this world. Born as a tiny, fragile being, unaware of the life waiting for me or the world I was about to enter. I didn’t know what my fate would be, but the moment of my birth marked love and joy for those eagerly waiting for me. At that very moment, a new chapter began-not just for me, but for those around me as well. My cry was the first sound I made as I entered an unknown world-one that was, unbeknownst to me then, filled with possibilities, responsibilities, and challenges.</p>
<h2>LITTLE STEPS, BIG DISCOVERIES</h2>
<img src="imgelle/elchs.jpg">
<p>As a toddler, this phase of my life was filled with boundless energy and a deep curiosity about everything. Each day felt like a new journey-learning to walk, talk, and explore the world around me. My small steps led to new, exciting discoveries. I spent my days laughing, playing until exhaustion set in, and sometimes throwing tantrums when things didn’t go my way. It was a time of pure innocence and constant discovery, where the world seemed vast and full of endless wonder.</p>
<h2>PLAYFUL PHASE</h2>
<img src="imgelle/elchpic3.jpg">
<p>As a child, as I grew, I began to understand more about the world. But nothing had changed-I was still curious and eager to explore. I started going to school, and it became a big part of my life. I was shy when it came to making friends, and I focused on learning new things. I loved playing, doing school activities, and reading to learn even more. The small challenges I faced felt like big achievements at the time-like learning to ride a bike or winning in the activities I participated in. These were the days full of wide and deep imagination. Simple days, but you could feel the genuineness in everything.</p>
<h2>TEENAGE GROWTH</h2>
<img src="imgelle/elchs2.jpg">
<p>As a high schooler, my year during this time was a period of growth and change. It was during these moments that I started to discover who I truly am and what I want in life. Somehow, I managed to balance academics, friendships, hobbies, and learning how to manage responsibilities while still having fun. There were moments of achievements-like getting high scores in quizzes and exams, and participating in school events or activities-but there were also moments of failure. I experienced struggles, peer pressure, and the challenge of figuring out where I truly belonged. There were times when I felt like I was falling apart-my grades dropped, and I was often absent due to personal problems. Despite everything, I persevered and managed to graduate from high school. Looking back, high school shaped me in many ways, teaching me the importance of resilience, hard work, being strong, and staying true to myself.</p>
<h2>ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE</h2>
<img src="imgelle/elchs4.jpg">
<p>At now, I’m 18, and a college student, I feel like I’m stepping into the threshold of adulthood. My life is more challenging than I thought, but it’s also more exciting. College pushes me to grow-not just academically, but also emotionally and socially. It’s a time of balancing newfound independence with responsibilities. It’s about figuring out what I really want to be while exploring my passions and meeting people from diverse backgrounds, upbringings, and perspectives. Even though it’s tough at times, I’m still learning to embrace my journey. Right now, I’m still dealing with my shyness, lack of confidence, and weakness in public speaking, just like before, so I feel like I’m wasting a lot of opportunities. I’ve learned not to beg or please other people, as it leads to a loss of personal boundaries, low self-worth, and unhealthy relationships. I now value the people who appreciate me for who I am today. I’ve also learned to prioritize myself before others, though I’m still dealing with saying NO to people, situations, and such things.</p>
<p>My goal right now is to overcome all the challenges that come my way and finish college. I want to save enough money to help those in need, repay the people who have been by my side and have sincerely and wholeheartedly helped me, especially my family. I also want to buy the things I desire without having to worry about the price or calculate before purchasing. I want to find my true purpose in life, to discover what is really meant for me. I want these things to happen, as I grew up in hardship, not in wealth, so I can’t achieve them right now-but I know I will be able to do so someday. As I’ve mentioned, we weren’t wealthy, so I kept reminding myself that I had to finish my studies-not just to give back to my parents and the people who support and help me, but to find happiness. For me, true happiness means achieving success in life.</p>
